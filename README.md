# DiabloDB
Database Class Project. A simple forum where users can create pages, post threads to pages, and comment on threads. Front end prototyped using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), back end built using Oracle's JDBC (Java) and SQLPlus.

### To view the site locally:
1. Watch installation video ```live-server``` [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q78u9lBXvj0) and download [here](https://github.com/tapio/live-server)
2. Run ```live-server ./DiabloDB/front_end/``` to open the page on port 8080 in browser
3. Click around, test forms etc. Everything is static at this point, and will be updated to a dynamic page soon.
